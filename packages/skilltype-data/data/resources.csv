"The State of Digital Preservation: A Snapshot of Triumphs, Gaps, and Open Research Questions",video,https://vimeo.com/308311561,12-7-2018,Digital Preservation; CNI; ITHAKA S+R,"Ensuring the long-term preservation of digital information for future users has been one of the key aspirations of the research library community. Ithaka S+R has been exploring the current state of digital preservation in order to identify research questions and areas for action. Based on interviews with 21 subject experts, we gathered perspectives on the successes, gaps, outstanding issues, and emerging needs in digital preservation. Although the conversations were open-ended, they were framed with questions to probe what seems to be working well now, new research workflows or cultural practices that require novel preservation strategies, and areas that need further attention and research. Our study shows areas of significant progress in the preservation landscape as the community has grown and has established important collaborations. However, the interviews revealed a number of concerns with the pace and nature of these developments and identified several issues that would benefit from further exploration. For this session, we plan to share what we have learned and gather feedback and additional perspectives, as we work to generate a research agenda for Ithaka S+R on digital preservation."

Software Carpentry in the Library: Partnering to Give Researchers Needed Technical Skills,video,https://vimeo.com/220344798,3-29-2017,Software Development; University of Oklahoma,"Basic programming and data management skills have become invaluable for creating reproducible research; however, this training is rarely included in graduate curriculum. Major grant-funded projects may be able to hire someone to provide these services, but the majority cannot. Recognizing this need, the University of Oklahoma Libraries has partnered with Software Carpentry, a non-profit foundation that offers two-day, hands-on workshops on basic programming skills designed to help researchers automate and track their research processes. The University Libraries has offered 12 local workshops since 2014 with over 300 faculty, graduate students, and staff from over 30 departments and research groups participating. We offer the workshops multiple times each semester — one before the semester starts, one during the middle of the semester, and one at the end of the semester. We have found that offering the mid-semester workshop during the week of Thanksgiving or Spring Break increases attendance since participants are more likely to be able to have two full days available. Each workshop is taught by library staff including experts in data management, informatics, and digital scholarship. By having library staff teach and attend the workshops, our team has gained a better understanding of our local researchers’ needs. The sessions also allow researchers to connect and develop relationships with specialists in the library, who can guide them through more advanced data and programming issues. Developing these relationships has helped to position the University Libraries as a nucleus for research on campus. During this briefing, attendees will learn best practices that have resulted from our experiences in planning and implementing such a program."

Building the Better eBook and Beyond,video,https://vimeo.com/203016568,11-30-2016,eBooks; Columbia University; Emory University; University of Michigan,"This session brings together several initiatives that are exploring the evolution of the monograph: (1) JSTOR Labs, an experimental platform development group, convened at Columbia University by a group of scholars, librarians, and publishers in October 2016. Together, they tackled this design question: if we applied data visualization and design thinking techniques to the existing corpus of digitized monograph files, how could we improve the discovery and user experience for scholars, students, and general readers? The first presentation will discuss the design principles and challenges that the expert group identified, demonstrate the working prototype created during a “flash build” at Columbia in November by JSTOR Labs, and explain how CNI attendees and others can take advantage of this openly available development. The lean, user-oriented product design process used for this project will also be outlined; a design process that any library or publisher can take advantage of for their own technology and innovation projects. (2) Emory University and the University of Michigan are working together on interrelated projects supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that explore how publishers can best support and sustain digital scholarship. Emory is leading a project to create a “Model Contract for Digital Scholarship” that can be used to set out roles and responsibilities around the selection, production, marketing, and preservation of a publication that takes full advantage of digital affordances, including open access. Michigan is developing a publishing platform optimized for digital scholarship, Fulcrum, built on the Hydra/Fedora framework. To ground the conversation, a concrete example of one new work of digital scholarship published by University of Michigan Press will be presented (“A Mid-Republican House from Gabii”). This is a multimodal work that cannot be presented in print and involves integrated narrative, datasets, and 3D models."
DRASTIC Measures: Digital Repository at Scale that Invites Computation (To Improve Collections),video,https://vimeo.com/206243022,11-29-2016,Digital Repositories; University of Maryland,"DRASTIC (digital repository at scale that invites computation), is an open source digital repository platform for creating horizontally scaling archives that serve the national library, archives, and scientific data management communities. Through the emerging DRASTIC community project we intend to provide a credible solution for Big Data management in large organizations in the cultural heritage, business, and scientific research communities. DRASTIC was developed by Archives Analytics Solutions ltd., in collaboration with the University of Maryland’s Digital Curation Innovation Center (DCIC) in the College of Information Studies as the result of a $10.5 M National Science Foundation grant. The software is based on the most widely used distributed database, Apache Cassandra, created to meet the scaling needs of companies like Facebook. DRASTIC supports integration by providing a standard RESTful Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI), a command-line interface, web interface, and messaging as contents are changed (MQTT). We will introduce the project, show participants how we use it today, and explain our plans to enhance archival data, perform computational analyses, and integrate with other archival platforms."

Building a Deeper Bench: Training Students to Provide Digital Scholarship Support,video,https://vimeo.com/220321311,4-4-2017,Professional Development; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,"This program highlights one new way that University of North Carolina Libraries services are enabling pedagogical and curricular change: by training Library student employees to provide substantial digital scholarship support. Historically, the Libraries have helped drive pedagogical change in four ways: 1.) Working directly with instructors on courses, assignments, and in curricular groups, 2.) Partnering with campus support organizations (e.g., teaching & learning center) to deliver programming, 3.) Introducing students to new skills and technologies through direct consultation and instruction, and 4.) Providing and integrating technology-enabled spaces into research and instruction. Recently, we have identified a fifth method: training and mentoring student employees in the delivery of digital scholarship research assistance. Training students to provide significant digital scholarship support gives them a hands-on work experience, engages them in new types of research, and develops their skills with emerging tools and practices. It also allows the Library’s many digital scholarship services to scale more readily, providing librarians with more time to engage with researchers on larger, complex projects and questions. In this session, we discuss the kind of work our students engage in, the growth of our training programs, and the curriculum that is beginning to emerge through our experience. We will draw from three examples: o Graduate students in the Science Library’s Makerspace providing 3D printing and 3D scanning consultations and instruction to faculty and students. o Graduate students in the Undergraduate Library developing tutorials and teaching workshops on digital media creation, including social media graphics and infographics. o Graduate and undergraduate students in the Davis Library Research Hub providing consultations and project support on a range of tools, from Tableau to Python.

Yet, critical information scholars continue to demonstrate how digital technology and its narratives are shaped by and infused with values that are not impartial, disembodied, or lacking positionality. Technologies consist of a set of social practices, situated within the dynamics of race, gender, class, and politics, and in the service of something -- a position, a profit motive, a means to an end. In this talk, Safiya Umoja Noble, Assistant Professor in the Annenberg School of Communication at USC, will examine the power struggles over representation on the web, and the consequences of marginalization and misrepresentation in commercial information platforms like Google search."

These discovery services are primarily based upon indexes derived from journals, ebooks and other electronic information of a scholarly nature. The content comes from a range of information providers and products--commercial, open access, institutional, etc. Given the growing interest and activity in the interactions between information providers and discovery services, a more standard set of practices is required for the ways that content is represented in discovery services and for the interactions between the creators of these services and the information providers whose resources they represent."

The design of these systems is inscribed with organizational and cultural values. Often, these systems depend on the behavior of everyday people, who may not act as expected. Meanwhile, adversarial actors also seek to manipulate the data upon which these systems are built for personal, political, and economic reasons. In this talk, danah will unpack some of the unique cultural challenges presented by ""big data"" and machine learning, raising critical questions about fairness and accountability. She will argue that we need to develop more sophisticated ways of thinking about technology before jumping to hype and fear."
Promoting Effective Research Data Management Practices Through Integration of Digital Research Tools,presentation,https://www.caudit.edu.au/system/files/Media%20library/Resources%20and%20Files/THETA%202017/Mon_1320_Helena%20Lynn%20THETA%202017.pdf,3-13-2018,Research Data; Digital Repositories; Research Management; University of Sydney,"While many researchers acknowledge the importance of engaging with research data management policies and practices, their compliance is often hindered by the lack of user-friendly platforms that meet RDM requirements and/or their specific research needs. Building additional functionality into these platforms, including streamlining the way they interact with additional tools/platforms allows for less time to be invested in curating research data. This improves user experiences and removes one of the barriers to researcher engagement with effective RDM."

Is the Value of the Big Deal in Decline,article,https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/03/07/value-big-deal-leakage/,3-7-2019,Publisher Relations; Open Access; Analytics; Technology; ,"Last week, the University of California system terminated its license with Elsevier. There has been a great deal of attention to California’s efforts to reach a Publish & Read (P&R) agreement. The what-could-have-been of this deal is interesting and important. But I wish to focus today on the what-no-longer-is of scholarly content licensing, focusing on the big deal model of subscription journals bundled together on a single publisher basis for three to five year deals. In the eyes of major libraries in Europe and the US, the value of the big deal has declined. As a result, we are moving into a new period, in which publisher pricing power has declined and the equilibrium price for content and related services is being reset. What is the principal culprit? I will maintain today that we must look in large part to what publishers call “leakage.”"

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,article,https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf,1-1-2011,Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Blockchain; Information Technology; Software Development,"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."
Predicting the Role of Library Bookshelves in 2025,article,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2017.06.019,06-19-2017,Strategic Planning; Management; ,"University libraries are questioning the added value of open shelves with books. As scientific publications are increasingly available in electronic format, which role do bookshelves have in the future library space? The Utrecht University Library case study invites librarians to fundamentally rethink how they could strengthen the function of open shelves in their library. Based on acquisition and user data, and on interviews with publishers and users, this article suggests that in 2025 bookshelves could play an important role in providing access to those publications which are preferred by users in paper format. However, bookshelves should no longer focus solely on paper publications, but on digital publications too, as most library collections increasingly become hybrid. Moreover, libraries should also think of ways to enhance the inspiring role of bookshelves. Then, the open shelves could have added value within the library space of the future, providing access to a hybrid collection and an inspiring place to study."
Rationality and politics of algorithms. Will the promise of big data survive the dynamics of public decision making?,article,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2018.10.011,10-15-2018,Data Science; Algorithms ,"Big data promises to transform public decision-making for the better by making it more responsive to actual needs and policy effects. However, much recent work on big data in public decision-making assumes a rational view of decision-making, which has been much criticized in the public administration debate. In this paper, we apply this view, and a more political one, to the context of big data and offer a qualitative study. We question the impact of big data on decision-making, realizing that big data – including its new methods and functions – must inevitably encounter existing political and managerial institutions. By studying two illustrative cases of big data use processes, we explore how these two worlds meet. Specifically, we look at the interaction between data analysts and decision makers. In this we distinguish between a rational view and a political view, and between an information logic and a decision logic. We find that big data provides ample opportunities for both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn't necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents rather than as links in a functional chain. Therefore, big data's impact cannot be interpreted only in terms of its functional promise; it must also be acknowledged as a phenomenon set to impact our policymaking institutions, including their legitimacy."
A Library Publishing Hub at University of Michigan: Interview with Jason Colman,article,https://blog.scholasticahq.com/post/library-publishing-hub-university-of-michigan/,6-4-2017,Open Access; Scholarly Publishing,"What’s the role of university libraries in supporting the dissemination of scholarship? Once focused on being keepers of research, university libraries have begun to transition into the role of research producers as well. In recent years, many have initiated open access (OA) scholarly journal publishing programs that offer a variety of services aimed at either launching and running new journals or supporting existing titles."
"Graphic Novels: Collecting, Cataloging and Outreach in an Academic Library",article,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2017.01.011,1-25-2017,Collection Management; Acquisitions; Cataloging,"Most major US universities have graphic novels in their library collections. Titles like Maus (Spiegelman, 1986) and Persepolis (Satrapi, 2004) have become staples in the stacks for their academic relevance and accessible style of delivering information through visually striking art. While some libraries have comprehensive collections and budgets to support them, many do not and thus have a collection that lacks cohesion and scope. The Brandeis University collection fell into that latter category, and we aimed to correct that. But beyond titles that have achieved scholarly notoriety and critical acclaim, like Maus and Persepolis, how does an academic library with little to no comprehensive collection create one and how does it engage students with acquired titles? For us, this began as a personal project. We individually enjoy reading graphic novels and were heartened to see our library already had titles like Fun Home (Bechdel, 2007) and Waltz with Bashir (Folman & Polonsky, 2009) in our collection, but there was no discernable method to how titles were acquired. For example, why Waltz with Bashir, but not Fax from Sarajevo (Kubert, 1998) or The Photographer (Guibert, 2009), which covered similar topics? Further exploration into the process uncovered that our system for acquiring graphic novel titles was on an ad hoc basis. We typically acquired titles as the result of faculty requests for course materials, items we received on our approval plan, or included in past donations. As a cataloging librarian and a social sciences librarian, we were in a unique position to do what librarians do best: bring order to chaos, and put together an organized plan to acquire and publicize the resulting collection so students see it and, more importantly, use it. But where to start?"
"Who support open access publishing? Gender, discipline, seniority and other factors associated with academics’ OA practice",article, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2316-z,3-6-2017,Open Access; Scholarly Publishing,"This paper presents the findings from a survey study of UK academics and their publishing behaviour. The aim of this study is to investigate academics’ attitudes towards and practice of open access (OA) publishing. The results are based on a survey study of academics at 12 Russell Group universities, and reflect responses from over 1800 researchers. This study found that whilst most academics support the principle of making knowledge freely available to everyone, the use of OA publishing among UK academics was still limited despite relevant established OA policies. The results suggest that there were differences in the extent of OA practice between different universities, academic disciplines, age and seniorities. Academics’ use in OA publishing was also related to their awareness of OA policy and OA repositories, their attitudes towards the importance of OA publishing and their belief in OA citation advantage. The implications of these findings are relevant to the development of strategies for the implementation of OA policies."

It is vital to academic libraries that the digital library services we provide — whatever their source — carry clear university brand identity. This strengthens the library’s position in the university and enables it to secure the budget and political capital necessary to do its work. Both libraries and their vendors have much to gain from this approach to brand. Here is how Columbia University developed a more formal approach for Library branding and achieved success with some of our largest vendors."
